how does the web work(Refresher)=>creating a node.js server => using node core modules => working with requests and responses (basics)=> Asynchronous code and the event loop

Streams and Buffers
Ex incoming requests
our stream is simply the ongoing process multiple parts in chunks 
a Buffers is like a bus stop , in sort buffer holds multiple chunks and work with thembefore they r released once we r done

Single Thread, Event Loop and Blocking Code 
a Thread is like a process of ur os u can say, 

Event loop is automatically started by node js when ur programs start u don't have to do explicitely is responsible for event call back
event loop : handle event callback
worker pool: is responsible for heavy liftingrun on different threads


debugging and easier development: fixing errors and developint efficiently

 "start":"node app.js",
    "server":"nodemon app.js" for running 
    npm run then ur script name

    Local Project
    Your code
    Core Node Package
    Dependencies (3rd Party)(express, body-parser,and others)

    installed and managed via npm



    -----------------------
    Types of Errors:
Syntax Errors: typo type easy to fix
Runtime Error: it will breaks when it runs
Logical Errors: most difficult one (ur app does doesn't work like u want there is some tool to solve this)

Syntax Error:
